# codeclimate-standardrb

CodeClimate Engine to run [standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard), which is a

> ðŸŒŸ Ruby Style Guide, with linter & automatic code fixer.

To use this in your project, configure CodeClimate to run the `standardrb` engine. Eg, add this to `.codeclimate.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  standardrb:
    enabled: true
```

If you need to build the image, `make image` is your friend.

`make run` will run a container against `./code`, which has some good and bad example code in.

## Internals

CodeClimate requires engines ship as docker images, so that's what we build. The container runs `bin/codeclimate-standardrb` binary and mounts the code for us to examine at `/code` within the container.

Basically this engine wraps standard which in turn wraps rubocop to examine code and flag warnings/errors about it.

* `CodeclimateStandardrb::Runner` abstracts away us calling Standard from ruby, save us having to shell out to call it.
* `CodeclimateStandardrb::Formatter` is a Rubocop formatter, which receives each offense and then outputs it in the format CodeClimate requires to STDOUT
